## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the OpenAI API, a Telegram bot which will generate an image using AI for the prompt you send to it using the command `/image [prompt]`. Like, for example, `/image bots getting to the Moon`.

## Set-up guide

### Getting keys
In order to use this bot yourself, you'll need to get two keys, one for the OpenAI API authorization and other one as a token for the Telegram bot. As for OpenAI, you can register and get your API key [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview). For the Telegram side, you can create a bot and get its token using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) inside the app.

### Setting up the environment

Once you've got both keys, create a .env file in the root of the project and then add the tokens there, the following way:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your token as string"
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your token as string"
```
Save the file and remember adding it to your .gitignore if you're pushing the code, otherwise you'd be sharing your keys.

### Running the bot

First, we need to install the dependencies in order for the bot to run correctly. From the root, just execute the following command.
```
npm install
```

That's it, we're ready to run the bot, just use this script:
```
npm run start
```

And that's all, you can now interact with your bot using Telegram.
